In this project, I developed a YouTube application utilizing the RapidAPI client for seamless data fetching. The platform features a comprehensive profile page where users can select specific tags such as Education, Music, and more to discover related videos. Additionally, the application offers a robust search functionality, empowering users to easily find videos based on keywords. Once a video is selected, users have the option to explore related content directly from the playback page. Moreover, the platform includes a dedicated section for channel details, allowing users to view all videos uploaded by specific creators or channels. Lastly, the application is deployed on Netlify, making it accessible to all users through the provided link.
